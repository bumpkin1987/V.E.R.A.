# Purpose
An attempt to create a live interactive voice assistant utilizing the ChatGPT model as the engine.

# Installation
Instructions for installing this project.

# Usage
While the app it running pay attention to the console indicatin when it has "started listening" and when it is "Done listening". During the 'listening' phase is when you will need to say "quit" explicitly or the program will continue to hit the openai endpoint with you prompt. This could potentially cost you more money than you were willing to spend. This will be mitigated as the project grows.
